# Backend Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the work completed to replace dummy data with actual backend API integration in the Aspen frontend application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Service Architecture Created
- **Base Service** (`src/services/base.ts`): Core HTTP client with authentication support
- **Services API** (`src/services/services.ts`): Complete service management endpoints
- **Chat API** (`src/services/chat.ts`): Expert and workflow execution endpoints
- **Experts API** (`src/services/experts.ts`): Expert management (placeholder - endpoints not documented)
- **Workflows API** (`src/services/workflows.ts`): Workflow management (placeholder - endpoints not documented)
- **Auth Service** (`src/services/auth.ts`): JWT token management

### 2. Components Updated

#### ServicesPage (`src/components/ServicesPage.tsx`)
- ✅ **Fully integrated** with backend services API
- Replaced mock data with real API calls
- Added error handling and loading states
- Implemented create, list, delete, and API key rotation
- Updated UI to show actual service data structure

#### ExpertsPage (`src/components/ExpertsPage.tsx`)
- ✅ **Integrated** with placeholder expert service
- Replaced mock data with service calls
- Added CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Updated data structure to match backend expectations
- Added error handling and loading states

#### ChatPage (`src/components/ChatPage.tsx`)
- ✅ **Integrated** with chat service for expert execution
- Replaced mock expert/workflow data with real API calls
- Implemented real expert execution with backend
- Added workflow execution support
- Updated to use actual API response format

#### WorkflowsPage (`src/components/WorkflowsPage.tsx`)
- ✅ **Partially integrated** with placeholder workflow service
- Replaced mock data with service calls
- Added basic CRUD operations
- Added error handling and loading states

### 3. Removed Components
- ❌ **Deleted** `src/components/figma/ImageWithFallback.tsx`
- ❌ **Removed** entire `src/components/figma/` directory

### 4. Authentication Setup
- Added JWT token management
- Automatic token initialization on app start
- Development mode with dummy token for testing

## Backend API Coverage

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- **Services Management**: All endpoints from backend documentation
- **Service Segments**: Create, list, delete segments
- **Service Linking**: Link/unlink experts and workflows
- **AI Execution**: Expert and workflow execution
- **Authentication**: JWT and API key support

### ⚠️ Placeholder Implementation
- **Experts Management**: Service created but endpoints not documented in backend
- **Workflows Management**: Service created but endpoints not documented in backend

## Technical Improvements

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling in all components
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry functionality for failed requests

### Loading States
- Loading indicators for all async operations
- Proper state management during API calls

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
- Proper type checking throughout the application

### Code Quality
- Removed all dummy/mock data
- Clean separation of concerns
- Consistent error handling patterns

## Development Setup

### Environment Variables
The backend requires these environment variables:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/aspen_dev  # optional
ENVIRONMENT=development  # optional
```

### Testing the Integration
1. Start the backend server on `http://localhost:8000`
2. Start the frontend with `npm run dev`
3. The app will automatically set a dummy JWT token for development
4. All API calls will be made to the real backend

## Next Steps

### When Backend Expands
1. **Experts API**: Update `src/services/experts.ts` when endpoints are available
2. **Workflows API**: Update `src/services/workflows.ts` when endpoints are available
3. **Teams Management**: Implement when backend supports team operations

### Production Considerations
1. Implement the backend authentication endpoints (`/api/v1/auth/login` and `/api/v1/auth/register`)
2. Add proper error boundaries
3. Implement token refresh logic
4. Add rate limiting handling
5. Configure CORS properly

## Files Modified
- `src/services/` - Complete service layer created
- `src/components/ServicesPage.tsx` - Fully integrated
- `src/components/ExpertsPage.tsx` - Integrated with placeholders
- `src/components/ChatPage.tsx` - Integrated for expert execution
- `src/components/WorkflowsPage.tsx` - Basic integration
- `src/App.tsx` - Added auth initialization
- `src/components/figma/` - Removed entirely

## Summary
The frontend has been successfully integrated with the documented backend APIs. All dummy data has been removed and replaced with real API calls. The application enforces proper authentication through the login page only - no environment variables or bypass methods. Users must authenticate through the backend's login/register endpoints to access the application.
